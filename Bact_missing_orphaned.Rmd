From this table we learn that as long as we model with only VIPs or with leukocyte-related variables, we can expect less than 10% missing values and this may justify a complete-case analysis. Including also kidney- and acute phase related variables will raise the proportion of missing values to about 36% which leads to a significant drop in power. A multiple imputation may then recover a lot of the information and may in particular be beneficial to keep the power of the (otherwise very complete) VIPs.
