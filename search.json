    "text": "The IDA framework consists of six steps Huebner, Vach, and le Cessie (2016) (figure 1).\nHere we assume that metadata (step I) exist in sufficient detail, and that data cleaning (step II) was already performed. Metadata summarize background information about the data to properly conduct IDA steps, and a data cleaning process identifies and corrects technical errors. The data screening (step III) examines data properties to inform decisions about the intended analysis. Initial data reporting (step IV) document insight of the previous steps and can be referred to when interpreting results from the regression modeling. Consequences of these analyses can be that the analysis plan needs to be refined or updated (step V). Finally, reporting of IDA results in research papers (step VI) are necessary to ensure transparency regarding key findings that influence the analysis or interpretation of results. Further details about the elements of IDA are discussed in Huebner et al. (2020).\n\n\n\nIDA framework, see Huebner, Vach, and le Cessie (2016)\n\n\nHuebner M, Vach W, le Cessie S, Schmidt C, Lusa L.

Thus, IDA tasks will be explained in a well-defined, practically relevant setting. Since a key principle is that IDA does not touch the research question no associations between dependent (outcome) and independent (non-outcome) variables are considered.\nTable 1: The scope of the regression analyses considered for IDA tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspects of the research plan\nAssumptions in this paper\nReason for the assumption\n\n\n\n\nDependent (outcome) variable\nOne dependent variable that can be continuous or binary; exclude time-to-event or longitudinal outcomes\nExplain IDA tasks in a well-defined, practically relevant setting\n\n\nRegression models\nModels with linear predictors\nExplain IDA tasks in a well-defined, practically relevant setting\n\n\nPurpose of regression model\nAdjust effect of one variable of interest for confounders; quantify the effects of explanatory variables on the outcome\nExplain IDA tasks in a well-defined, practically relevant setting\n\n\nIndependent variables\n“explanatory” or “confounder” depending on purpose of model; small to moderate number of mixed types; Not high dimensional; no repeated measurements\nTo demonstrate IDA approaches for a mix of variables likely to be encountered in practice\n\n\nStatistical analysis plan\nExists, defines the outcome variable, the type of regression model to be used, and a set of independent variables\nIDA does not touch the research question, but may lead to an update or refinement of the analysis plan\n\n\n\nReferences:\nVach W.
